"""Adapter checkpoint resolution: the directory mlx-vlm's LoRA loader expects.

mlx-vlm's ``apply_lora_layers(model, adapter_path)`` requires ``adapter_path``
to be a **directory** containing exactly ``adapter_config.json`` and
``adapters.safetensors`` (both fixed filenames, read from inside that
directory) -- this is precisely the layout the frozen training pipeline's
``mlx_vlm.lora`` run writes to ``checkpoints/<run_name>/`` (see
``training/command.py``'s ``--output-path`` / ``training/checkpoints.py``'s
``CheckpointConfig.output_dir``). This module never hardcodes a run name or
crop, so it resolves the same way for tomato, a future mango run, or any other
``checkpoints/<run_name>/`` directory.
