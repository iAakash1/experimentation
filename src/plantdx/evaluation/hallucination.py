"""Hallucination detection: deterministic, DKB/vocabulary-grounded, reproducible.

Detection is lexicon-based (never an LLM judge -- consistent with the project's
"no LLM/VLM in the pipeline" invariant, and fully reproducible). Four of the six
checks read directly from the frozen DKB / compiled vocabulary artifacts (agent
names, forbidden non-observable symptoms, other-disease names); the crop and
treatment lexicons are small, hand-authored keyword lists, since the training
corpus never emits that language at all -- any occurrence is inherently
suspect, regardless of source.
