"""Split Builder (doc 04 §5).

Builds image-grouped, disease-stratified train/val/test splits plus a held-out
``diagnostic`` split of the hardest confusable pairs. Grouping by image prevents
caption-level leakage; splits are seeded and versioned so all four models train
and evaluate on identical partitions.
