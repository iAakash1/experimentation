"""Disease Knowledge Base loader and integrity checker (interface).

Responsibilities (Milestone 2):
    * parse ``knowledge_base/dkb.json`` into :class:`KnowledgeBase`;
    * compute and record ``dkb_sha256`` (pins the source of truth in provenance);
    * run the DKB self-checks that the caption framework depends on
      (e.g., no ``never_appear`` term also appears in a ``recommended_*`` list;
      every non-healthy disease has diagnostic terminology) — see doc 01 §8.

The loader never mutates the DKB; it is a read-only projection.
